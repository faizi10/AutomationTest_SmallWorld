# AutomationTest_SmallWorld

## Introduction

Welcome to the test automation project for the Swag Labs website. This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding and contributing to the automation efforts. Whether you're a new user or an experienced test engineer, this guide provides all the necessary information to help you achieve your goals.

## Requirements

### Operating System:
- The test automation project is compatible with any operating system that supports Java and Maven.

### Development Environment Setup:

#### 1. IntelliJ:
- Download and install the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA.
- Open IntelliJ and create a new Maven project or open an existing one.
- Install necessary plugins, such as Cucumber for Java, to enhance your development experience.

#### 2. Maven:
- Download and install the latest version of Maven.
- Ensure that the `MAVEN_HOME` environment variable is set, and the `bin` directory is added to your `PATH`.
- In your project's POM file, add the necessary dependencies for your testing frameworks (e.g., Selenium, TestNG, Appium).

#### 3. Java SDK:
- Download and install the latest version of the Java SDK.
- Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the installation directory of the Java SDK, and add the `bin` directory to your `PATH`.

### Programming Language:
- The Swag Labs website is built on the Java programming language.

### Testing Framework:
- The test automation project uses TestNG and Cucumber for test management, and Allure for reporting.

### Dependencies:
- Install the necessary dependencies such as TestNG, Cucumber, Allure, WebDriverManager, and Selenium.

## Test Design

### 1. Cucumber: Crafting Test Scenarios
- Cucumber is a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) framework supporting human-readable Gherkin syntax.
  - Create a feature file with a `.feature` extension.
  - Provide a concise feature description.
  - Formulate test scenarios using Gherkin keywords.

### 2. TestNG
- TestNG is a powerful testing framework that seamlessly integrates with Cucumber.
  - Create a Java class for the test suite extending `AbstractTestNGCucumberTests`.
  - Utilize TestNG's SoftAssert class for soft assertions.

### 3. Page Object Model
- Implement the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for maintainable and reusable test automation.
  - Develop a separate Java class for each page or screen.
  - Define instance variables for page elements.
  - Create methods for interacting with elements and executing actions.

## Test Execution

### Cucumber with TestNG Configuration
- Configure Cucumber with TestNG for test execution.
  - Create a test runner class extending the base test class (e.g., `TestBase`).
  - Add the `@CucumberOptions` annotation to configure Cucumber settings.

## Test Reporting

### Allure
- Utilize Allure for comprehensive test reporting.
  - Configure the test automation framework to use the Allure plugin.
  - Install the Allure command-line tool.
  - Generate and view the Allure report after test execution.

## Conclusion

This test automation project for the Swag Labs website, powered by TestNG, Cucumber, Allure, and Selenium, aims to make test automation accessible and efficient. Follow the provided instructions to quickly set up and contribute to the project. Keep the project and dependencies up-to-date for maximum compatibility and reliability. Happy testing!
